Happy with purchase overall. by ROBBIE Verified Purchase Helpful? Report Review Mar 22, 2024 Disappointed with Poway Home Depot Is it really new? These things aren’t cheap, so you expect something to be delivered in good condition. This mower was dirty, just like your car gets after spending time sitting outside in the rain. There is surface rust on the frame and mower blades. The battery voltage was below 12v, not useable without being charged. The manuals were soaking wet, not damp, soaked. One manual was for a completely different mower engine. There was only one key, surely there should be two. There was barely a trace of oil, since it had leaked out onto the frame from the oil drain plug being so loose, like almost falling off loose. When I ordered it, it was scheduled for a next day delivery, a few hours later I get a call saying it couldn’t be delivered for another two days past the original delivery date, because…, IT HAD TO BE PREPPED! Seriously? I guess I should be happy there is air in the tires. Very poor prepping folks. I would love to add more photos but it only allows one. by Disappointed This review is from XT1 Enduro LT 46 in. H 23 HP V-Twin Kohler 7000 Series Engine Hydrostatic Drive Gas Riding Lawn Tractor (CA Compliant) Response from CubCadet Show Mar 25, 2024 Hi Disappointed. We are sorry to hear about the issues with your new mower. Regarding the key, only one is included with the mower and any additional keys are available separately. Concerning the oil, we include a sample bottle of oil and no oil should have been in the unit. To discuss your experience and for the correct engine manual, please contact us directly at 1-877-428-2349 and mention your case number 09461988 so we can help. Thank you for rating our product. Recommended Helpful? Report Review Nov 14, 2023 Unfinished Assembly Very happy with my XT1 L46. I use this unit to mow weeds on 5 acres. Flats/slopes this unit traverses them well.   Pleased with the position of all the controls. BUT my assembled unit didn't have the oil drain pipe/valve tightened. Oil leaked causing a mess. I tried to tighten myself. It's nearly in contact with the oil filter with no room to turn a wrench. Poor design. by srf74 This review is from XT1 Enduro LT 46 in.

My only issue, the blade sent to me, for mulching, is not the correct blade.  No one on the store, Ludington, seems to know how to get me a replacement.

H 23 HP V-Twin Kohler 7000 Series Engine Hydrostatic Drive Gas Riding Lawn Tractor (CA Compliant) Verified Purchase Helpful? 1 found this review helpful Report Review Mar 20, 2023 Engine blew up with less than 100 hours This mower was great at first. It had great power, mowed nice and straight. Fast forward a year and a half into ownership and the piston rod shot through the side of the block AT IDLE. I was letting it warm up after a long winter to get fluids moving. It was idling at the lowest RPM for about a minute. Oil level was checked before starting. They are refusing to cover my engine under warranty without the original purchase receipt. Poor customer service and poor engine reliability.

H 23 HP V-Twin Kohler 7000 Series Engine Hydrostatic Drive Gas Riding Lawn Tractor (CA Compliant) Recommended Helpful? Report Review Oct 19, 2022 So far so good! The good: excellent turning radius; ergonomic; lots of power; multiple hight settings, small wheels on the mower deck to avoid scalping; convenient refueling cap position; good LED lights. The seat has a built in drain for rain; cup holders. The Bad: more plastic then I like; throttle assembly looks like fragile plastic positioned so a knee could break it; the optional bagger undersized cheaply made and is a one size fits none design which actually uses a kind of dryer hose for a bagging chute. It came in a crate partially assembled. by Sean This review is from XT1 Enduro LT 42 in. 19.5 HP Kohler 5400 Series Engine Hydrostatic Drive Gas Riding Lawn Tractor Verified Purchase Recommended Helpful? 4 found this review helpful Report Review Aug 24, 2022 Do not over think, just buy the Cub Cadet.

I recommend it for those who are looking for something that is affordable. by WAPNW Recommended Helpful? Report Review Jun 28, 2022 Excellent mower for dense brush or large lawns I’ve had this mower for three years and have put 80+ hours on it. It’s held together well and has proven much more capable than I expected. I have 2.5 acres of vines, plus another 1.5 acres of mixed lawn and semi-wild space. This mower keeps it tidy. I’m always surprised when I’m able to drive through 3’ grasses and blackberry vines. It will big down sometimes if you try to chew too much at once, and replacing the blades regularly make a big difference.

Just a few complaints. The front tires that came with it have always been slow leakers - not during a day of use, but a month later they’ll be flat. Also the mowing deck belt likes to jump off if I disengage it while the motor is running. Also after three years the front wheels are toed out and need alignment.

But it’s a workhorse on the vineyard and I’m glad I did my homework before buying. by AnActualPerson This review is from XT1 Enduro LT 46 in.
