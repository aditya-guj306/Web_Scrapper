    A node that generates an answer using a large language model (LLM) based on the user's input
    and the content extracted from a webpage. It constructs a prompt from the user's input
    and the scraped content, feeds it to the LLM, and parses the LLM's response to produce
    an answer.

    Attributes:
        llm_model: An instance of a language model client, configured for generating answers.
        verbose (bool): A flag indicating whether to show print statements during execution.

    Args:
        input (str): Boolean expression defining the input keys needed from the state.
        output (List[str]): List of output keys to be updated in the state.
        node_config (dict): Additional configuration for the node.
        node_name (str): The unique identifier name for the node, defaulting to "GenerateAnswer".
